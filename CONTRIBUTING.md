# Contributing to NextApp

We welcome contributions to the NextApp project! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines.

## Communication

Before starting work on a major feature, please reach out to us via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Santinni/nextApp/issues). We will make sure no one else is already working on it and discuss the best way to implement it.

## Git Flow

We use a Git flow strategy:

- The `main` branch is for stable, released code.
- The `develop` branch is for development.
- Feature branches should be created for new features and merged into `develop` when ready.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

- We indent using four spaces (tab).
- We use ESLint to check our JavaScript.
- We adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Commit messages should be written in the following style: `#123 - Add: a new feature`.
- We use CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if applicable).

## Using Storybook

We plan to use Storybook for our UI library. Contributions to the library should follow the conventions used within Storybook.
