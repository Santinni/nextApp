# NextApp

This is the main branch of NextApp, a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Overview

NextApp is a modern web application leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. The development process happens on the `develop` branch, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Santinni/nextApp/tree/develop).

## Getting Started

To get started with NextApp, clone the main branch and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santinni/nextApp.git
cd nextApp
yarn install
```

then checkout to development branch

```bash
git checkout development
```

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3030 with your browser to see the result.

## Development

Development happens on the `develop` branch. Please refer to the [develop branch README](https://github.com/Santinni/nextApp/tree/develop) for more detailed instructions on development workflow and guidelines.

## Deployment

The project is configured for easy deployment on the Vercel platform, though it can be adapted to other environments as needed. For detailed instructions, check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

## Icons

NextApp has a custom icon workflow which integrates with Figma. For more information on how to import and use icons, please refer to the [develop branch](https://github.com/Santinni/nextApp/tree/develop).

## Future Plans

In the future, we aim to introduce a UI library showcased in Storybook to enhance the development experience and provide a comprehensive view of UI components. Currently, we are evaluating Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI and CSS Modules to determine the best approach for our styling needs.

Stay tuned for updates on the integration of the UI library and Storybook in this project.

Additionally, we are exploring the possibilities of adopting Turbopack as our build tool. Turbopack represents the next generation of build tools, promising faster rebuild times and more efficient bundling processes, which could significantly improve our development workflow and application performance.

Stay tuned for updates on the integration of the UI library and Storybook in this project, as well as our decision on the adoption of Turbopack.
